/*Here, the definition of the PID class begins. This is indicated by the keyword: "class"
This is a general description of the data and functions that the class contains. 
To use a class, we must make a specific instance of the class by declaring it into the same way we declare a variable. 
For example, to create a version of the PID class, in our main file we might write:

PID LeftWheelPID;
PID RightWheelPID;

This will create two instances of the PID class; one for the left wheel and one for the right wheel. 
Each class will have a full copy of all the variables and functions defined for that particular class.

{
  /* Public functions and variables are defined here. A public function / variable can be accessed from outside 
   * the class. 
   * For example, once we have made an instance of the PID class, we can call the update function by writing:
   * 
   * LeftWheelPID.update();
   * 
   * Note that this will only update the LeftWheelPID - RightWheelPID will not be updated unless we also call 
   * RightWheelPID.update()
